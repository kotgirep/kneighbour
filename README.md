The following strategies can be used to determine exact k nearest:

1.Exhaustive search entails matching each position to any point, which takes time (the size of the dataset).

2.The Grid Trick entails sectioning the area into a grid, that necessitates increasing time and space (in the dimensionality of the dataset).
This is problematic because we're dealing with high-dimensional datasets.
